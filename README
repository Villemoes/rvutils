RVutils
=======

This is (or will become) a random collection of small bits of C, perl,
python that I've written and found useful on more than one occasion.


tailq_sort
==========

If you use the macros from <sys/queue.h> instead of writing your own
linked list implementation a few times each month, you may at some
point have wanted a routine for sorting the list. Well, I did, so I
wrote tailq_sort.{c,h}. It uses VLA-in-struct (see the commit message
for the rationale), but it is easy enough to rip out the code and
adapt it for a specific type.

quickstat
=========

I've often written some a long shell pipeline to extract or compute
numbers from some data, only to find myself needing a way to summarize
these numbers. Sometimes I needed their sum, sometimes their average,
and sometimes I simply wanted to get a feeling for how they are
distributed. Also, I was tired of writing 

  ...  | awk '{x += $1} END {print x}'

just to get their sum. So I wrote quickstat, which computes some of
the most common statistics, and which can also produce simple
histograms of the data.
