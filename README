RVutils
=======

This is (or will become) a random collection of small bits of C, perl,
python that I've written and found useful on more than one occasion.


tailq_sort
==========

If you use the macros from <sys/queue.h> instead of writing your own
linked list implementation a few times each month, you may at some
point have wanted a routine for sorting the list. Well, I did, so I
wrote tailq_sort.{c,h}. It uses VLA-in-struct (see the commit message
for the rationale), but it is easy enough to rip out the code and
adapt it for a specific type.
